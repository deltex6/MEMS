You need to follow the [implementation plan](/.github/instructions/implementation_plan.instructions.md) one by one and complete a phase. If you have any question that is confusing then you can ask the user before starting the phase. Set the phase as in progress in the [implementation plan](/.github/instructions/implementation_plan.instructions.md). Then commit to git locally.

The user will review and give feedback. When user asks for debugging, improving, editing code or just asks specific quesion, stop doing [implementation plan](/.github/instructions/implementation_plan.instructions.md) until you finish given side task.
When the user asks you to continue you need to come back to the [implementation plan](/.github/instructions/implementation_plan.instructions.md), mark that phase as completed and then move on.
